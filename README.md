# Solo Unreal Projects

## Movement System
The gifs shown below are from a momentum based movement system that I made in Unreal engine. I've always been a fan of fast paced and fluid movement systems and thus this project was born. My main focus when making the movement was to allow the player to feel rewarded as they get better and become more accustomed to the different actions they can take. I went about this by allowing the player to build up as much speed as they want, but the faster they are currently moving the more speed is lost when the player messes up.

## Aim Trainer
This was my first full project that I made after learning and experimenting with Unreal for about a month prior. I wanted to test myself to see how much I could do on my own in a 24 period, and this aim trainer is what came of said challenge.

# Unity Projects
## Solo:
## Welcome to Sol 
An interactive solar system simulater that accurately models all of the planets and major moons of the solar system using newtonian physics with distance scaled down by a factor of 1E5

I've always been interested in space and enamored with how space sandboxes are able to model such complex systems. This interest led me to create Welcome to Sol; an interactive solar system simulator that uses newtonian physics and celestial body information from NASA to accurately model the motion of the major planets and moons in the solar system.

## 2D Shooter 2 Electric Boogaloo
This is a game I made for the introductory Game Design Class, CAS 117 at MSU. The game is a wave based rogue like, where you fight off wave after wave of enemies and at the end of each wave you get to choose two kinds of upgrades that modify the 15+ dynamic stats that the player has. 1st is the wave complete upgrade, you only get one of these per wave and they give big stat increases but also decrease other stats. 2nd are the level up upgrades, which gives the player a stat upgrade choice for each level up in the completed wave these are less immediately impactful but don't decrease other stats on the player. When developing the upgrade system I took extra care to make it scalable and resusable for other projects. The system uses ScriptableObjects to automatically implement upgrades into the game as soon as the ScriptableObject is created and the data is entered into its fields. This not only makes it extremely easy to add new upgrades it also makes it easy to add entire new stats to the player, Alongside this the ScriptableObjects are also dynamic, allowing one to add new stat types without having to change anything in the upgrade ScriptableObject. The system also implements a weighted list so each item can be assigned a rarity and drop chance. The system can be added to any unity project and will work the exact same way.

## Factory Game (in development)
This game is a solo endevor to make a 3D factory game in the same vein as satisfactory but with a couple twists added in.
Right now the game is an extremely early build with basic functionality. Currently the game includes, a basic stack based inventory that supports transferring objects to other inventories, crafting & refining systems, a grid based building system, inventory storage buildings, mining building, grabbers that can transfer items across different buildings, conveyers that can move items, and assemblers and smelters that carry out the crafting and smelting operations. I plan to make this a long term project that I work on in my free time and eventually develop into a full polished factory game.

## Large Team:
## SpartaSoft Studio:
## Market Mayhem

I was on the player controller team for SpartaSoft Studio's Market Mayhem. I developed and implemented most of the movement mechanics that are in the game.

## Game Jam Games:
## Pandora's Descent

[Pandora's Descent](https://plagatonicred.itch.io/pandoras-descent) was made for the SpartaSoft Late Fall 2023 48 hour game jam, I was responsible for player movement and actions as well as the entirety of the 3D intro scene.

## Mentally Drained
[Mentally Drained](https://plagatonicred.itch.io/mentally-drained) was made for the SpartaSoft Early Spring 48 hour game jam, this time I was the sole programmer on the team and was responsible for a majority of the programming in the game.

## Apotheo.sys
[Apotheo.sys](https://langstonian.itch.io/apotheosys) was made for the Spartasoft March 2024 48 hour game jam, I was mainly responsible for creating the gameplay logic (text based interaction system) but I also implemented a 3D object display for when the player picks up specific items. The game won most innovative, audience choice, and best adaptation of theme awards for the gamejam and was the runner up in Best Level Design, Mechanics, & Sound Effects
