## Factory Game (in development)
This game is a solo endevor to make a 3D factory game in the same vein as satisfactory but with a couple twists added in.
Right now the game is an extremely early build with basic functionality

## Game Jam Games:
## Pandora's Descent

[Pandora's Descent](https://plagatonicred.itch.io/pandoras-descent) was made for a 48 hour game jam, I was responsible for the player controller and the entirety of the 3D intro scene. 
This was also my first time working on any game in 2D.

## Mentally Drained
[Mentally Drained](https://plagatonicred.itch.io/mentally-drained) was also made for another 48 hour game jam, this time I was the sole programmer on the team and was responsible for all of the programming in the game.
